        "Despite the growing adoption of smart home technologies, current systems still struggle with reliably detecting emergency hazards, such as gas/water leaks when no one is home, and accurately identifying potential security threats, often confusing homeowners with intruders. These limitations reduce trust in smart home automation and can lead to serious safety risks.\n",

        "### Goal:\n",
        "Develop a multi-agent AI system capable of analyzing diverse smart-home sensor inputs in real time to accurately detect hazards and security breaches, and deliver real-time alerts to the homeowner. The system should improve reliability, reduce false alarms, and enhance overall safety."
